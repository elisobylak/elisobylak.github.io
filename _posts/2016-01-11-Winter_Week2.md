title: Winter Quarter, Week 2
---

This is my first post for the online journal we are keeping over the next two quarters that will follow along the work done on our projects for Student Originated Software.

I have decided to work on the Thurston County Votes Application alongside my class-mate Brianna. We first heard about the project when Carrie Wack and Valerie came and spoke to our class about this opportunity. They are both from the Thurston County Auditor's Office and have been charged with creating a mobile application. This app will center around targeting those with a mobile device(primarily people my age) and attempting to get them to be more civically engaged. It will also help educate and give awareness to the election and voting process in Thurston County. 

Carrie has invited Brianna and I to meet with her on January 15th which is this Friday and discuss where we are going with this project. As an outline, she has sent this in an email;

"Required Mobile App Content:

Election Results by District (SOS)
Current Election: Candidates and Voters’ Pamphlet (Auditor Website)
Election Results (Secretary of State’s Office [SOS])
Election Dates for that Year (Auditor Website)
District and Precinct Map (Auditor Website)
My Districts and elected officials (Auditor Website)
Ballot Drop Box Locations (Google Map Application)
Register to Vote (SOS)
element(s) that attracts and engages the Millennial generation


Milestones:
1. first App due Jan 15, goal: be familiar with Android development environment.
2. report on tools for portable (cross-platform) Apps (iPhone and Android)
3. Display election results from archives

Issues:
how will App be updated?
2016 will be very busy, what will be ready when?
Next election is in February
Communicate technical information to Carrie

Resources:
Valerie has experience with video and graphics production

Use case 1:
voter wants to find the nearest ballot boxes with distances and
have them displayed on a map.

Use case 2: (need to verify)
voter wants to know the election results for their district in Thurston County.
They enter their zip code or district number"

In addition, Richard has suggested that we bring an example application to our meeting. This is what I have got so far;

To create this android app, I am using Meteor. This is a service that uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create web-based applications for both Android and iOS platforms. It can also therefore be accessed via a browser which makes it cover pretty much all mobile bases. As far as the example app I have mocked up here, it includes a simple interactive google map instance centered around Thurston County. Below this, is a simple list of Ballot Drop Boxes in the Olympia Area. This is what I am going to bring to our meeting and see what they have to say.

I think this is a pretty cool project with hopefully big implications in the way of nudging millennials toward civic engagement.
